                Touches can be created for future or past events.
              </span>

              <h3>Here’s how it works:</h3>
              <span>
                <ul class="orderedList">
                  <li>
                    Add the People and Organizations that you’ve had an interaction with to the Touch.
                    Next time you navigate to those contacts’ profile pages, the Touch will appear in their Touches tab.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Attach any files to the Touch that you want to store in conjunction with the interaction.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Share your Touches with teammates or the public by placing them in a shared or published Database.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Easily search for relevant Touches after labeling them with tags. (see <em class="link-to-section energized" ng-click="vmMaster.deepModal('query');">TAGS & QUERYING</em>).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Report on your Touches in Excel with Shuri’s reporting feature (see REPORTING WITH SHURI)
                  </li>
                </ul>
                Touches are customizable and you can track and record any kind of interaction that you’ve had with your contacts (see <em class="link-to-section energized" ng-click="vmMaster.deepModal('touchTypes');">TOUCH TYPES</em>).
              </span>

              <!-- Media Capture Touch -->
              <h3>Media Capture Touch</h3>
              <span>
                The Media Capture Touch is a simple way to record and save quotes from the Twitter or AR Research feeds on Shuri’s homepage. Once you find a post that you’d like to capture as a Touch, find the Touch icon in the same box as the post and select. This will attach the post to a Touch create page, where you can enter in more information, if desired, before clicking <em>Save</em>.
