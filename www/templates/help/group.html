                Once you’ve added your contacts into Databases, and/or subscribed to Shuri’s Analyst Relations Database the best way to compile your Favorites is through Groups.
                <br /><br />
                Groups are a way to group together contacts from across all of your Databases into one, easily accessible place.
                You can make as many Groups as you’d like and we’ve started you out with your first one for Favorites.
              </span>

              <h3>All of your Favorites in one place</h3>
              <span>
                You can Favorite any contact by clicking the star on the top of their profile page.
                This feature is also available for tags.

              <h3>From Group to Database</h3>
              <span>
                Have a Group that you think might make a better Database?
                No problem, click the pencil next to the Group’s name.
                Then, click <em>Promote to Database</em> at the top of the page, assign it an Editing Team if you’d like and click promote.
                You’ll also have the option to share this Database with all Shuri users for free.
                <br /><br />
                <i class="icon ion-information-circled energized"></i> Note: every contact added to a Group will still live in its assigned Database and can be accessed in both places.
