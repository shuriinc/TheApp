                    With Shuri you can generate Briefing Books in Microsoft Word and reports in Microsoft Excel. We offer templates for you to use, or you can create and upload your own.
                </span>
                <h3>Briefing Books</h3>
                <span>
                    At Shuri, we understand how integral Briefing Books are to an AR practice, and are attuned to each company’s unique Briefing Book needs. With this in mind, we’ve created a Briefing Book engine that’s easy to use and fully customizable.
                </span>
                <h3>Create a Briefing Book or Excel report from an existing template</h3>
                <span>
                    <ul class="orderedList">
                        <li>
                            Create a Group comprised of the analysts or Touches you’d like to use.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Navigate to the People or Touch query page and run a query for your Group.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once you have your results, click on the <em style="font-style:italic;">Reports</em> tab at the top of the page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Here, you’ll see a list of templates that Shuri offers under the <em style="font-style:italic;">Reports and Templates</em> tab. Simply clicking on a template will generate a report or Briefing Book on those items that were listed in your query results.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once the report is generated, it will display in the list below, under the <em style="font-style:italic;">My Reports & Export Files</em> tab.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Click on the report and it will download to your device or desktop and open in Word or Excel.
                            <ul class="orderedList" style="list-style-type: circle;">
                                <li>
                                    With Shuri’s Briefing Book templates you will automatically see: an analyst’s basic contact info, a photo, bio, their tags and your 5 most recent Touches with them. You’ll also have the opportunity to fill out specifics for each analyst, including: information about the upcoming meeting and a short paragraph on their perception of your product.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    With Shuri’s Touches Report in Excel, you get your data reported in 4 different worksheets: <em style="font-style:italic;">Simple</em> will include only basic info about the Touch, <em style="font-style:italic;">Everything</em> will give you all data from every Touch, <em style="font-style:italic;">TouchesPeople</em> will break your Touches down by all people involved, and <em style="font-style:italic;">TouchesTags</em> will be broken down by tags.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
                    This is just a start. If you want to include custom fields or change the formatting, read on to learn how to customize your own template.
                </span>
                <h3>Create or modify your own template</h3>
                <span>
                    To modify or create your own report templates with Shuri, you need to have an understanding of token replacements.
                    <br /><br />
                    Token replacements act like placeholders for data in Shuri. For example, if a Briefing Book template contains, %firstname% %lastname%, once the report is generated it will display instead with the first and last name of a selected person.
                    <br /><br />
                    Template:
                    <br /><br />
                    <img src="https://shuristoragecdn.blob.core.windows.net/public/help-images/Template.png" alt="Template image" />
                    <br /><br />
                    Template after running a report from a query:
                    <br /><br />
                    <img src="https://shuristoragecdn.blob.core.windows.net/public/help-images/Templateafterrunningareportfromaquery.png" alt="Template image" />
                    <br /><br />
                    The basic principle of tokens is that a % sign needs to go both before and after the name of a field from Shuri. With this principle in mind, you can create a report that includes any and all of your custom fields, as long as you tokenize them in the template.
                    <br /><br />
                    (Example: if you have a custom field named "Perception" and you’d like to include that data in your report, simply add %Perception% to your template).
                </span>
                <h3>To modify one of Shuri’s Briefing Book templates or Excel report templates:</h3>
                <span>
                    <ul class="orderedList">
                        <li>
                            Click the 3 bars on the template of your choice and select <em style="font-style:italic;">Download Copy</em>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Select the downloaded file, which will open up in Word or Excel.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Unlike simply clicking on the template, which will generate a Briefing Book or report, this action downloads the original template with all tokens still in place.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            From here, feel free to edit the document to your liking.
                            <ul class="orderedList">
                                <li>
                                    For access to more tokens, click on the "i" icon on the <em style="font-style:italic;">Reports</em> tab to see a token glossary.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>
                            Once you’re happy with your template, save it with a unique name.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To upload your template click the plus sign on the <em style="font-style:italic;">Reports & Templates</em> tab on the <em style="font-style:italic;">Reports</em> page. This will open up your Finder for you to choose your new template file.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Next, if you’ve uploaded a Word document, a pop up will appear asking what kind of report template you’d like to create. In the case of a Briefing Book, select Paginated with 1 item per page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once you select <em style="font-style:italic;">Upload</em> your template will be added to your Shuri account permanently, unless you delete it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can now create Briefing Books and Excel reports from your own template with a simple click.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your template will automatically be included in your Default Database, so anyone else sharing that database with you will now see the template on their <em style="font-style:italic;">Reports</em> page, as well.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    To generate a Briefing Book on a single analyst, navigate to their profile page, click to open the <em style="font-style:italic;">Reports</em> tab, and select a template listed. This will automatically generate a report on the analyst in question.
                    <br /><br />
                    If you want to upload a template made completely by your own design, make sure to use Word or Excel and the correct tokens. Then, simply upload the file using the same steps described above.

                <h3>Other Microsoft Word reports</h3>
                <span>
                    With Shuri’s simple use of token replacements, the sky's the limit on how many different kinds of reports you can create in Word, including: tables, mail merge, name tags, and labels, just to name a few. As long as you use the correct tokens, you can report on data from Shuri in any way that you need.
                </span>
                <h3>Table reports in Word</h3>
                <span>
                    To create a table template in Word:
                    <ul class="orderedList">
                        <li>
                            Start with a new Word document.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Insert a table with only 2 rows.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use the first row to name your columns.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In the second row, insert the matching Shuri tokens to each column and save your document.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Click the plus sign in the <em style="font-style:italic;">Reports & Templates</em> tab on Shuri. In the pop-up select Table as the Word Template type.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Click on the template to generate a report, where your table will expand its rows to include all of your data.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </span>
                <h3>To insert a table into a Briefing Book:</h3>
                <span>
                    <ul class="orderedList">
                        <li>
                            Create your table template in Word and upload it to the correct <em style="font-style:italic;">Reports</em> tab in Shuri (ie. a table reporting on Touches needs to be uploaded to the <em style="font-style:italic;">Reports</em> tab on the Touches page, etc…).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On your Briefing Book template, choose where you’d like the table to display and add: %rptTouches%reportname%
                            <ul class="orderedList">
                                <li>
                                    The reportname must be typed exactly as it is named in Shuri
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    You can optionally add a number at the end of this token, followed by another % sign, to include only the latest items in the table (ie. with: %rptTouch%Recent Touches%5%, only 5 of the most recent Touches would display in the completed Briefing Book).
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                </span>
                </ul>
                <h3>Doing more with Excel</h3>
                <span>
                    With Shuri’s token replacement system, you can also create Pivot Tables in your Excel template utilizing the desired tokens. Once the report is generated, your data will report into the Pivot Table, giving you a chance for more analysis of your interactions.
                    <br /><br />
                    To learn more about creating Pivot Tables in Excel, see: <a href="http://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/pivot-tables.html" target="_blank">http://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/pivot-tables.html</a>
                    <br /><br />
                    Note: There is a limit to how many items you can report on at once (People: 1,000 max; Orgs: 150 max; Touches: 50,000 max). Make sure to narrow your search results before trying to generate any new reports.
