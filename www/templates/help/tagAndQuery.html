                Tags act as labels that you can add to any person, organization or Touch in Shuri.
                When you want to find specific contacts or Touches quickly, run a query for certain tags and a list will display that you can take action with.

              <h3>A good reason to use tags:</h3>
              <span>
                Mark wants to track US Senators and their recent votes. In this case, he can separate the Democrats from the Republicans using tags.
                <ul class="orderedList">
                  <li>
                    First, he'll create a tag set titled Political Party from a Database’s customize page. For more information on how to create a tag set, see <em class="link-to-section energized" ng-click="vmMaster.deepModal('tagset');">TAG SETS.</em>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Then, Mark will create one tag for Democrat and one tag for Republican.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Back on each Senator’s profile page, he'll click to open the tags tab and type in the appropriate tag.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    That tag will show up in the drop-down menu and Mark can select it. Now his item is labeled.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </span>

              <h3>Query to easily find what you’re looking for</h3>
              <span>
                For Mark to see a list of only the Senators in the Democratic Party:
                <ul class="orderedList">
                  <li>
                    He will navigate to the People page (from the link on the bottom of the homepage).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Then, he'll select <em style="font-style:italic;">Query</em> from the top navigation bar.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Mark will then open either of the the <em style="font-style:italic;">Tags</em> tabs and select Democrat from within the Political Party tag set.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Next, he'll click <em style="font-style:italic;">Run Query</em> and a list of only those Democratic Senators in his Database will appear.

                  </li>
                </ul>
                Enhance your Query by:
                <ul class="orderedList">
                  <li>
                    Specifying only certain Organizations to search in.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Searching for people or orgs within close proximity to either your current location or another location chosen.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Specifying query requirements by field (ie. First Name field must contain "Robert")
                  </li>
                </ul>
                Run similar queries on Organization and Touch query pages.
              </span>

              <h3>Do more with your data</h3>
