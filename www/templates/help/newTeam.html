                To collaborate with other Shuri users you’ll need to create a shared Database by assigning it an Editing Team. Then, every member of that Team will have access to view and edit its content. You can also share the Database with a Team to get view-only permissions.
                <br /><br />
                To start with creating a Team first, simply enter in a name and toggle on for <em style="font-style:italic;">Create a Team Database.</em>
                <br /><br />
                This will make a new Database with your Team assigned to it.
                Teammates will automatically see both the Team and Database on their homepages after logging in, and can start working with them.

              <span>
                To add teammates, click on your Team’s name from the Shuri homepage.
                Start typing a teammate’s name into the People tab and find your desired entry listed in the drop-down menu.
                Make sure that all of your teammates have made Shuri accounts before taking this step.
