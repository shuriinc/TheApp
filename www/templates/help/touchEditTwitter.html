                Touches can be created for future or past events.
              </span>

              <h3>Here’s how it works:</h3>
              <span>
                <ul class="orderedList">
                  <li>
                    Add the People and Organizations that you’ve had an interaction with to the Touch.
                    Next time you navigate to those contacts’ profile pages, the Touch will appear in their Touches tab.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Share your Touches with teammates or the public by placing them in a shared or published Database.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Easily search for relevant Touches after labeling them with tags. (see <em class="link-to-section energized" ng-click="vmMaster.deepModal('query');">TAGS & QUERYING</em>).
                  </li>
                </ul>
                Touches are customizable and you can track and record any kind of interaction that you’ve had with your contacts (see <em class="link-to-section energized" ng-click="vmMaster.deepModal('touchTypes');">TOUCH TYPES</em>).
              </span>

              <!-- Social Media Touch -->
              <h3>Social Media Touch</h3>
              <span>
                The Social Media Touch makes it possible to post Tweets, Facebook and LinkedIn updates to any account from within the Shuri app.
                <br /><br />
                If you’re not already signed into Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn you’ll be prompted to do so. Then craft your post and choose to either send now or schedule for a future date and time.
              </span>
              <!-- Twitter Touch -->
              <!-- <h3>Twitter Touch</h3>
              <span>
                The Twitter Touch makes it possible post Tweets to any Twitter account from within the Shuri app.
                <br /><br />
                If you’re not already signed into Twitter, you’ll be prompted to do so.
                Then craft your Tweet and choose to either send now or schedule for a future date and time.
                <br /><br />
                Note: you’ll need to create a title for the Touch.
                This won’t show up in Twitter anywhere, but is necessary so that you can easily find the Touch later.
